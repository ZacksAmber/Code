# Introduction
# As we all know, Japan used to be the richest country in Asia. In its most
# prosperous period, it could buy the whole US with only one Tokyo. However,
# we already know that this was caused by the huge real estate bubble resulting
# from the rapid increase of the exchange rate of Japanese yen to the US dollar.
# Now, China has surpassed Japan to become the world's second-largest economy.
# Research shows that the ratio of China's first-tier cities and local per
# capita wages have exceeded four times that of Tokyo at the time. But China's
# per capita GDP is far less than that of Japan. In other words, In the case of
# China's first-tier cities, the relative housing prices in the first-tier
# cities are higher than those in Japan at the time. Does this mean that
# China's housing prices are too high? Will China's housing prices continue to
# grow? What are the factors related to China's housing prices? Is any economy
# bubble in China real estate? These questions are very attractive to me.
# Therefore, we want to study the relationships between housing prices and
# other factors in China's capital (one of the first-tier cities).
# The raw data is collected by lianjia.com, the biggest housing agency in China.
# All trade time was in January 2018. This dataset has 14 factors.
# Factors:
# [numerical - continuous] price: Housing price per squared meter(unit: ¥, RMB)
# [numerical - continuous] square: The area of the apartment (unit: square meters).
# [numerical - discrete] livingRoom: The number of living rooms.
# [numerical - discrete] drawingRoom: The number of drawing rooms.
# [numerical - discrete] kitchen: The number of kitchens.
# [numerical - discrete] bathRoom: The number of bathrooms.
# [numerical - discrete] floor: The number of the floor of the apartment.
# [categorical - nominal] buildingType: including tower(1) , bungalow(2)，combination of plate and tower(3), and plate(4).
# [numerical - discrete] constructionTime: the time of construction.
# [categorical - nominal] renovationCondition: including other(1), rough(2),Simplicity(3), and hardcover(4)
# [categorical - nominal] buildingStructure: including unknown(1), mixed(2), brick and wood(3), brick and concrete(4),steel(5) and steel-concrete composite (6).
# [categorical - nominal] elevator: Is there an elevator?
# [categorical - nominal] subway: Is there a subway nearby?
# [categorical - nominal] district: District code of Beijing.
# Make sure the raw data and the program are in the same working direction.
